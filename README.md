# camper-cafe
A simple HTML and CSS cafe menu web application created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification course. This project demonstrates my ability to build a responsive layout that provides a user-friendly experience, showcasing the cafe's offerings in an organized and visually appealing manner.
